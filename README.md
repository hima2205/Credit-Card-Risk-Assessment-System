# Data
The dataset features 284,807 credit card transactions recorded over two days in September 2013 from cardholders in Europe; among these, 492 transactions are identified as fraudulent, making up 0.172% of the total. The dataset's input variables are numerical and result from PCA transformation, with V1 to V28 representing the principal components. The 'Time' variable measures the seconds elapsed since the first transaction, and 'Amount' indicates the transaction amount. The 'Class' variable is the response variable, identifying whether a transaction is fraudulent. Original data features and detailed background information are withheld for confidentiality reasons.

• Time: Time elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

• V1 to V28: These are the principal components obtained through PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The original features are transformed for privacy reasons,hence these anonymized components.

• Amount: Transaction amount.

• Class: The response variable where 0 indicates a normal transaction and 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction
